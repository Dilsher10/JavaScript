    <h1>Throttling vs Debouncing in JavaScript: What's the Difference and When to Use Each?</h1>


    <p>Debouncing and throttling are two commonly used techniques in software development to control the rate at which a
        function is executed in response to some input. The main difference between these two techniques is that
        debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a certain amount of time has passed without the input
        being triggered again, while throttling limits the frequency at which a function can be executed.</p>



    <p>Here's an example to illustrate the difference between the two techniques:</p>



    <p>Imagine you have a search bar on a website that sends a request to the server every time a user types a letter.
        If the user types quickly, this could result in multiple requests being sent to the server in a short period of
        time, which can cause unnecessary load and slow down the website.</p>



    <p>To prevent this, you could use a debounce function to delay the search request until the user has finished
        typing. For example, if you set a debounce time of 500 milliseconds, the search request will only be sent after
        the user has stopped typing for half a second. This ensures that only one request is sent to the server even if
        the user types quickly.</p>



    <p>On the other hand, if you want to limit the frequency of the search requests, you could use a throttle function.
        For example, if you set a throttle time of 500 milliseconds, the search request will only be sent once every
        half a second, even if the user types quickly. This ensures that the server is not overloaded with requests and
        that the website remains responsive.</p>



    <p>In summary, debounce delays the execution of a function until after a certain amount of time has passed without
        the input being triggered again, while throttle limits the frequency at which a function can be executed.</p>



    <h1>Chat GPT Response</h1>


    <p>Debouncing and throttling are both techniques used to control how often a function is executed, especially for
        events that fire rapidly (like scrolling, resizing, typing, etc.). Here's a breakdown of the difference between
        the two:</p>

    <h2>Debouncing</h2>

    <p>Definition:</p>

    <p>Debouncing ensures that a function is only called after a certain delay has passed since the last time it was
        invoked.</p>

    <p>Use Case Example:</p>

    <p>Typing in a search box and triggering an API call. You want the API to fire only after the user has stopped
        typing for, say, 500ms.</p>

    <p>How it works:</p>

    <p>If the event keeps firing, the timer resets every time. The function only executes if the event hasn't happened
        again in the delay window.</p>

    <p>Visual:</p>

    <p>keypress ---- ---- ---- (pause) ---> function fires</p>




    <h2>Throttling</h2>

    <p>Definition:</p>
    
    <p>Throttling ensures that a function is called at most once every X milliseconds, no matter how many times the event
        is triggered.</p>

    <p>Use Case Example:</p>
    
    <p>Window scroll or resize event. You want to run a function every 500ms at most, even if the event fires 100 times per
        second.</p>

    <p>How it works:</p>
    
    <p>The function is executed, and then it wonâ€™t execute again until the delay has passed.</p>

    <p>Visual:</p>

    <p>scroll -- function fires -- wait 500ms -- function fires -- wait 500ms ...</p>
