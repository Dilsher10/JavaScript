If you're preparing for a frontend interview at a FAANG company (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google), here are examples of realistic and commonly asked frontend developer interview questions based on feedback from past candidates:


*********************** Technical & Coding Questions (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) ************************


1-JavaScript & Browser Concepts:


Whatâ€™s the difference between == and ===?

Explain how event delegation works in JavaScript.

What is the event loop in JavaScript?

How does async/await work under the hood?

What are closures and how are they used?




2-Performance Optimization:


How would you improve the performance of a large web application?

What causes reflows/repaints in the browser? How can you minimize them?

Explain lazy loading and how you would implement it.




3-React/Frameworks (if applicable):

Explain the virtual DOM and how React uses it.

What are hooks in React? Difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?

How would you handle state management in a large-scale React app?




4-CSS & Layout:


Difference between position: relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.

How does Flexbox differ from CSS Grid?

How do media queries work? Write one for mobile devices.





******************** System Design (for Frontend) **********************


1. Design a dashboard with real-time updates.

2. How would you build a highly performant image gallery with infinite scroll?

3. How would you structure a large-scale frontend application (SPA)?

4. Design a component library system used across multiple teams.





***************** Behavioral Questions (FAANG-style) ***********************


1. Tell me about a time you had to make a trade-off between performance and code readability.

2. Describe a difficult bug you faced and how you resolved it.

3. Have you ever disagreed with a product manager? What did you do?

4. How do you ensure code quality across a team?






******************** Data Structures & Algorithms (Coding Rounds) ********************


Even for frontend roles, FAANG companies may ask:

* Two Sum, Merge Intervals, Valid Parentheses (LeetCode easy/medium)

* Debounce/throttle function implementation

* DOM traversal/recursive tree rendering

* Autocomplete input using Trie or basic algorithms
