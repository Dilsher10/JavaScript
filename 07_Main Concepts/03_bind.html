    <!-- In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are methods of functions that allow you to control the value 
    of this inside the function. They are especially useful when working with objects and method borrowing, 
    or when you need more control over how a function is executed.


    Why We Use call, apply, and bind

    Main Purpose:

    To explicitly set the value of this inside a function.-->



    <script>
        // 3. bind() – Preserving this in Async/Event Context (React-like)

        // Does NOT invoke the function immediately.

        // Returns a new function with this bound.

        // JavaScript loses this context in callbacks (like in event handlers or setTimeout), so bind() is useful.

        // Q: What happens if you don’t bind this in a callback (like in setTimeout)?

        // Ans: You lose the original context, and this becomes undefined (in strict mode) or the global object.

        // Why not always use bind? Why use call or apply instead?

        // bind() is great for later execution, especially in event handlers or callbacks.

        // call() and apply() are better when you want immediate execution.

        // Also: bind() creates a new function, which can be less performant if you’re inside a loop.




        function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
            console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
        }

        const person = { name: 'Dilsher' };

        const greetDilsher = greet.bind(person, 'Hey', '?');
        greetDilsher();




        const button = {
            text: 'Click me',
            handleClick: function () {
                console.log(this.text);
            }
        };

        const boundClick = button.handleClick.bind(button);
        setTimeout(boundClick, 1000);




        //  You don’t use .bind() for inheritance.

        //  because bind() is used to fix the value of this in a function — not to inherit from another function or class.
    </script>
